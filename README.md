DTAmetasa is a user-friendly and powerful application designed for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) with a focus on sensitivity analysis for publication bias (PB). Developed as part of the MEPHAS suite of applications, DTAmetasa offers a web-based graphical user interface using the R shiny framework. One of its key features is the sensitivity analysis of PB, providing users with graphical results to evaluate the magnitude of publication bias under various mechanisms. The application simplifies the analysis process and enhances the interpretability of results, particularly in assessing the impact of PB on the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve or the summary area under the curve (SAUC). DTAmetasa supports a wide range of publication mechanisms, making it a valuable tool for researchers conducting meta-analyses in the field of diagnostic test accuracy.
